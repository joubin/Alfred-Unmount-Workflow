Alfred Unmount Workflow
=======================

A workflow for [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com) 2.0+ that will unmount all physically connected devices![](http://i.imgur.com/gxaeZ3k.png?1)

Why?
======
If you're like me, you like to use external displays while you're on you're laptop at home.

AND If you're like me, you would also have your Time Machine hard drive along with other drives connected to your computer either through the thunderbolt on the displays, or a usb hub.

But you can't just unplug it without getting yelled at by OSX and instead of unmounting them all by hand, you can just run this
Installation
======

You can download the ready-made extension here: [download](http://cl.ly/3d0r410u3P1X)  
Alternatively clone the repository to you local machine.  
Simply doubleclick `AirDrop.alfredworkflow` to install.
I have also included the the script I used inside the source folder if you'd like to recreate this

Usage
======

Typing `unmount` in Alfred and press enter. 

A notification will pop open when the process starts
