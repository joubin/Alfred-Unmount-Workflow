=======================

A workflow for [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com) 2.0+ that will provide a quick shortcut to change the state of your wifi

Why?
======
I made this plugin because I hate to move my had away from the keyboard and shortcuts allow me to do that.

Mainly I made this because I use a dock at home on my MBA, the dock provides me with ethernet connections which is much faster inside my house.

Installation
======

You can download the ready-made extension here: [download](http://cl.ly/1B2u0N35243V)  
Alternatively clone the repository to you local machine.  
Simply doubleclick `WiFi` to install.
I have also included the the script I used inside the source folder if you'd like to recreate this.

You should never install workflows without being able to read the source code

Usage
======

Typing `wifi` in Alfred and provide one of the following options:

> on
 
> off

>restart 

A notification will pop open when the process starts
